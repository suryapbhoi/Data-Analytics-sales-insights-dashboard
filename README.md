## The Problem Statement
+ AtliQ Hardware Corp, head quartered in New Delhi, India, is witnessing decline in revenue from last 6 quarters
+ The Sales Director of the company is currently relying on excel files (output data from SQL queries run on the MySQL database) to find the reasoning in the  decline in sales and revenue
+ Deriving potential insights and issues from static data files is very challenging
+ Unable to make quick decision about promotional offers, marketing campaigns etc. due to the absence of a functional tool which can provide ample reporting of the data



## The Solution
+ The objective was to leverage the data and create a functional and interactive dashboard about the companyâ€™s reveneue and sales
+ The dashboard enabled management to take data-driven decisions to announce promotional offers, discounts, marketing or advertising campaigns
+ The solution was achieved by the Visualisation/BI tool (Tableau) which leveraged the existing sales and revenue data to build the dashboard
+ The visualisation was shared across stakeholders using URL and opened in any browsers



## The Dashboard
